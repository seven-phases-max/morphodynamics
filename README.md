# morphodynamics

An experimental [**Less**](https://github.com/less/less.js) library for CSS animations. Crafted to test and explore edge cases of recently added or upcoming (for 2014 :) [**Less**](https://github.com/less/less.js) features.

Because of this library purpose, its [internals](https://github.com/seven-phases-max/morphodynamics/tree/master/src) are meant to be scary, overengineered, hackish, cluttered, undocumented and muddily. So far enjoy this [**Demo**](http://seven-phases-max.github.io/morphodynamics/hover.html) (or [view the source code](https://github.com/seven-phases-max/morphodynamics/blob/master/demo/less/hover.less) used to generate all CSS animations there).
